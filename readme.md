# Lab | Common table expressions

## Introduction

In this lab, you will be using the northwind database.

## Getting Started

In this lab you will be working on [main.ipynb](main.ipynb). To launch it, first navigate to the directory that contains `main.ipynb` in Terminal, then execute `jupyter notebook`. In the webpage that is automatically opened, click the `main.ipynb` link to launch it.

When you are on `main.ipynb`, read the instructions for each cell and provide your answers. Edit the jupyter notebook cells and enter your `sql` code within. 

Jupyter Notebook should automatically save your work progress. But it's a good idea to periodically save your work manually just in case.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses to each of the exercises.


## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
